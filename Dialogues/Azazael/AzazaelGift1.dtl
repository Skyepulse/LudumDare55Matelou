Azazael: That's... weirdly thoughtful? I mean, I *have* been feeling alone, trapped here with, erm, *your lot*. So it's great to know at least someone acknowledged me.
set {Gift} = randi() % 3
if {Gift} == 0:
	Azazael: I'm extremely thankful for that, I'll find a good spot for it. Little ray of sunshine in this otherwise very dark cave.
elif {Gift} == 1:
	It's the thought that counts, so thanks for trying.
else:
	I would like it a whole lot better if I never had to see this thing again.
