Azazael: Oh, it's you again?
- Are you still trapped here?
	Azazael: No, I've found an exit but decided to hang out in this charming place... if you don't mind, I've got better stuff to do than answer stupid questions.
- I haven't found a way out for you, sorry.
	Azazael: Well, at least you're trying to help. The guy at the entrance told me I needed a red slip but Belzebub's right hand told me to get bent. Can you believe it?
