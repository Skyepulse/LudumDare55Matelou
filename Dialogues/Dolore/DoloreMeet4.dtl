Dolore: I've just been scolded by Gos, can you believe it? The corones of this guy? We're the same grade! Eff that, *I have higher seniority*!
- Yeah, sure, but you're a slacker.
	Dolore: Bullshit! I'm doing my job! It's none of my business if the Big Boss refuses to create extra jobs. He's just trying to pawn off more work without fair compensation!
- He's definitely a bootlicker, we don't have to overwork ourselves for the sake of the Boss.
	Dolore: Damn right! You seem like a smart guy. Tell you what? You should go to the club afterhours, maybe you'll find something great.
